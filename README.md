							DUNGEON ESCAPE


## Project Description
Dungeon Escape is a mobile game developed with Unity 3D. 
Players progress by engaging their characters in battles against enemies and earning rewards as they defeat them. 
These rewards can be utilized through an in-game market system I have integrated. 
Through the market, players can purchase various upgrades and advantages to enhance their character's abilities, making the gameplay more strategic and engaging.
